#### How to use

1. Disable [SIP](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html)[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection)
2. Execute ***NightShiftPatcher.sh*** script with superuser privileges (using [sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo), for example)
3. Don't forget to reenable SIP. This is not required, but recommended for system security ;)
